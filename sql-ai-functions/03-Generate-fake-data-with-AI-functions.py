# MAGIC # 2/ Introduction to SQL AI Function: generating fake data with Open AI apis
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For this demo, we'll start by generating fake data using `AI_GENERATE_TEXT()`. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The sample data will mimics customer reviews for grocery products submitted to an e-commerce website.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Working with `AI_GENERATE_TEXT` function
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our function signature is the following:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC SELECT AI_GENERATE_TEXT(<Prompt to send to Open AI model>,
# MAGIC                         "azure_openai/gpt-35-turbo",
# MAGIC                         "apiKey", <SECRET>,
# MAGIC                         "temperature", <TEMPERATURE>,
# MAGIC                         "deploymentName", <Azure Deployment Name>,
# MAGIC                         "resourceName", <Azure Resource Name>)
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `AI_GENERATE_TEXT` will send the prompt to the remote model configured and retrive the result as SQL.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's see how to use it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <!-- Collect usage data (view). Remove it to disable collection. View README for more details.  -->

# MAGIC ## Our first SQL AI function
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's try a simple SQL AI function. We'll ask Open AI to generate a text for a retail product review.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *Note that for now SQL AI functions will only work on a **Databricks SQL Pro or Serverless warehouse**, and **not** in a Notebook using interactive cluster.*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To make this demo easy to navigate, we'll use Databricks [SQL Statement API](https://docs.databricks.com/api-explorer/workspace/statementexecution/executestatement) to send our SQL queries to a SQL PRO endpoint that we created for you with this demo.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *(Alternatively, you can copy/paste the SQL code a new Query using [Databricks SQL Editor](/sql/editor/) to see it in action)*

# COMMAND ----------

#See companion notebook
sql_api = SQLStatementAPI(warehouse_name = "dbdemos-shared-endpoint", catalog = catalog, schema = dbName)

df = sql_api.execute_sql("""
SELECT AI_GENERATE_TEXT("Generate a short product review for a red dress. The customer is very happy with the article.",
                        "azure_openai/gpt-35-turbo",
                        "apiKey", SECRET("dbdemos", "azure-openai"),

# MAGIC ### Adding a wrapper function to simplify the call
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Having to specify all our parameters can be hard to use, especially for Data Analyst who should focus on crafting proper prompt and not secret management. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To simplify our demo next steps, we'll create a wrapper SQL function `ASK_OPEN_AI` with a string as input parameter (the question to ask) and wrap all the model configuration.

# MAGIC ## Generating a more complete sample dataset with prompt engineering
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that we know how to send a basic query to Open AI using SQL functions, let's ask the model a more detailed question.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll directly ask to model to generate multiple rows and directly return as a json. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here's a prompt example to generate JSON:
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC Generate a sample dataset for me of 2 rows that contains the following columns: "date" (random dates in 2022), 
# MAGIC "review_id" (random id), "product_name" (use popular grocery product brands), and "review". Reviews should mimic useful product reviews 
# MAGIC left on an e-commerce marketplace website. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The reviews should vary in length (shortest: one sentence, longest: 2 paragraphs), sentiment, and complexity. A very complex review 
# MAGIC would talk about multiple topics (entities) about the product with varying sentiment per topic. Provide a mix of positive, negative, 
# MAGIC and neutral reviews
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Return JSON ONLY. No other text outside the JSON. JSON format:
# MAGIC [{"review_date":<date>, "review_id":<review_id>, "product_name":<product_name>, "review":<review>}]
# MAGIC ```
