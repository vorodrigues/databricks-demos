# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we will explore the SQL AI function `AI_GENERATE_TEXT` to create a pipeline extracting product review information.

# MAGIC ## Simplifying AI function access for SQL users
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As reminder, `AI_GENERATE_TEXT` signature is the following:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC SELECT AI_GENERATE_TEXT(<Prompt to send to Open AI model>,
# MAGIC                         "azure_openai/gpt-35-turbo",
# MAGIC                         "apiKey", <SECRET>,
# MAGIC                         "temperature", <TEMPERATURE>,
# MAGIC                         "deploymentName", <Azure Deployment Name>,
# MAGIC                         "resourceName", <Azure Resource Name>)
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In the [previous notebook]($./03-Generate-fake-data-with-AI-functions), we created a wrapper `ASK_OPEN_AI` function to simplify our SQL operation and hide the configuration details to end-users. We will re-use this function for this pipeline.

# MAGIC In order to simplify the user-experience for our analysts, we will build prescriptive SQL functions that ask natural language questions of our data and return the responses as structured data.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ./_resources/00-init $catalog=dbdemos $db=openai_demo

# DBTITLE 1,Review our raw data
#See companion notebook

# MAGIC ## Review analysis with Open AI prompt engineering 
# MAGIC &nbsp;
# MAGIC The keys to getting useful results back from a GPT model are:
# MAGIC - Asking it a well-formed question
# MAGIC - Being specific about the type of answer that you are expecting
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In order to get results in a form that we can easily store in a table, we'll ask the model to return the result in a string that reflects `JSON` representation, and be very specific of the schema that we expect
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here's the prompt we've settled on:
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC A customer left a review on a product. We want to follow up with anyone who appears unhappy.
# MAGIC Extract all entities mentioned. For each entity:
# MAGIC - classify sentiment as ["POSITIVE","NEUTRAL","NEGATIVE"]
# MAGIC - whether customer requires a follow-up: Y or N
# MAGIC - reason for requiring followup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Return JSON ONLY. No other text outside the JSON. JSON format:
# MAGIC [{
# MAGIC     "product_name": <product name>,
# MAGIC     "category": <product category>,
# MAGIC     "sentiment": <review sentiment, one of ["POSITIVE","NEUTRAL","NEGATIVE"]>,
# MAGIC     "followup": <Y or N for follow up>,
# MAGIC     "followup_reason": <reason for followup>

# MAGIC ### Going further
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our pipeline is ready. Keep in mind that this is a fairly basic pipeline for our demo.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For more advanced pipeline, we recommend using Delta Live Table. DLT simplify data ingetsion and transformation tasks with incremental load, materialized view and more advanced features suck as MERGE operation or CDC and SCDT2. For more details, run `dbdemos.install_demo('dlt-loans')`

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Extra: AdHoc Queries
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Remember that analysts can always use the `ASK_OPEN_AI()` function we created earlier to apply their own prompts to the data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As short example, let's write a query to extract all review about beverages:

# COMMAND ----------

display(sql_api.execute_sql("""
  SELECT review_id,
    BOOLEAN(ASK_OPEN_AI(
      CONCAT("Does this review discuss beverages? Answer boolean: 'true' or 'false' only, lowercase, no explanations or notes nor final dot. Review: ", review)
    )) AS is_beverage_review,
    review
  FROM dbdemos.openai_demo.fake_reviews LIMIT 10"""))
